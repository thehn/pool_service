## Requirements analysis. Data structures & system architecture design

### Requirements-based analysis

1. Pools need to access and update by `poolId` as quickly as possible, and these operations also need to be concurrent. 
   Therefore `ConcurrentHashMap` could be a proper data structure (access / search by key: `O(1)`).
2. To create data structure to store pool values, we need to take these criteria into account: <br>
    - Pool values keep updating frequently, especially the pool size is not limited. 
      So the program should be able to update pool value efficiently and pool capacity must be easily
       extendable.
    - Performance of inserting or appending new values to pool should be considered with the highest priority.
    - To calculate the quantile, the pool values must be sorted. Sorting a big collection is very expensive and time-consuming, so it
       would be better to maintain a pre-sorted one.

### Design & Implementation

#### Pool data structures
For the above analyzed of requirements, I decided to choose buckets as a main data structure of pool values storage. 

- A pool values will be stored into a hashmap of buckets. Map key is bucket id. Map value is a single bucket. 
Each bucket is constructed by <mark>Red-Black-Tree</mark> implementation which is a <mark>self-balancing binary search tree</mark>.
- AVL Tree could be an option, but AVL trees store the balance factor at each node. This takes `O(N)` extra space. 
For an insert intensive tasks, Red-Black tree is winner.
- When a value is appended to a pool, it will be inserted to one bucket by its value. 
The insertion time complexity is O(logN), but we have all buckets sorted.  
- Each node of bucket is actually a map entry. Each entry is a pair of `<key,value>` 
where `key` and `value` represent for an unique `poolValue` and number of its occurences it the pool respectively.  
Thanks to this implementation, the number of iteration needs to traverse whole pool is always less than or equal the pool size.
It equals to number of unique values in pool. (1)

In my opinions, using independent buckets to store data can not only leverage parallel processing where it can reduce computation time,
but also it can partitioning to other node if the workload is not fit in memory of a single node.

#### Quantile calculation

In most case, quantile calculation needs to access 2 consecutive elements of a pool values. 
With current implementation, accessing to an element at index `i-th` takes `O(k + B)` where `k` = id of bucket containing `i-th` element and `B` is that bucket size.  
To reduce the accessing time, I implemented an extension of `get(int index)`, 
it is `get2ConsecutiveElements(int index)` where it can return `i-th` and `i-th + 1` in one single access.

Quantile calculation is not cheap, it is better to cache the calculated values in memory to improve the UX.

#### Time complexity
Let assume N is total values of a pool, B is bucket capacity, U is number of unique values in a bucket (U <= B <= N),
then the time complexity of each operation can be estimated as below:

- Insert: `O(B log B)`
- Append: `O(B log B)`
- Access: `O(U)`
- Quantile calculation: `O(U)`


### High availability, scalability & resiliency.

#### Database <br />
- It requires semi-structured data, no relational at all => we can use NoSQL DB to achieve scalability, high
  availability and high performance over SQL Database. <br />
- To reduce data access latency and I/O load => use in-memory cache like Redis or Memcached.
- We can also use Redis as primary database because besides using as an in-memory caching service, it can be
  configured to persist data to persistent storage like files or other databases such as MongoDB, PostgresDB ...
- It has data replication, partitioning
- Redis is single threaded => atomic operations (atomicity) are provided in natural way without any overhead or
  extra cost of synchronization). <br />

#### Make use of Kubernetes cluster services <br />

Our program is stateless, very easy to deploy to Kubernetes to utilize load balancer and many other services (
quick deployment, health check, auto-scaling, auto start-over ...) => Resiliency improved !

<b><i> This architecture can turn the application into a cloud service without much effort </i></b>

### Consideration.

* [Can redis single threaded become a bottleneck issue?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49304856/how-redis-deal-with-1000-requests-in-concurrency/49346017)

> "It's not very frequent that CPU becomes your bottleneck with Redis, as usually Redis is either memory or network bound. For instance, using pipelining Redis running on an average Linux system can deliver even 1 million requests per second, so if your application mainly uses O(N) or O(log(N)) commands, it is hardly going to use too much CPU"

* [Redis is single threaded, but how does it do concurrent?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10489298/redis-is-single-threaded-then-how-does-it-do-concurrent-i-o)

### Future researches.

- How to update quantile efficiently: Consecutively calculate quantile without cache clearance
- Multiple instances of Redis & treating them as different servers
